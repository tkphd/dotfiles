## My initialization file for GNU nano.
##
## To make sure an option is disabled, use "unset <option>".
##
## Quotes inside string parameters don't have to be escaped with
## backslashes.  The last double quote in the string will be treated as
## its end.  For example, for the "brackets" option, ""')>]}" will match
## ", ', ), >, ], and }.

## Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
## tabs and/or spaces as the preceding line -- or as the next line
## if the preceding line is the beginning of a paragraph.

set autoindent

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.  Note that
## this overrides "quickblank".

set constantshow

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If the value is 0 or less, the wrapping point will be the screen
## width less this number.

set fill 79

## Remember the used search/replace strings for the next session.

set historylog

## Display line numbers to the left of the text.

set linenumbers

## The opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
## searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set must
## come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order.
set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Use the blank line below the title bar as extra editing space.

set morespace

## Don't wrap text at all.
# set nowrap

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).

set smarthome

## Use smooth scrolling as the default.

set smooth

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.

set tabsize 4

## Snip whitespace at the end of lines when justifying or hard-wrapping.

set trimblanks

## Paint the interface elements of nano.  These are examples;
## by default there are no colors, except for errorcolor.
# set titlecolor brightwhite,blue
# set statuscolor brightwhite,green
# set errorcolor brightwhite,red
# set selectedcolor brightwhite,magenta
# set numbercolor cyan
# set keycolor cyan
# set functioncolor green
## In root's .nanorc you might want to use:
# set titlecolor brightwhite,magenta
# set statuscolor brightwhite,magenta
# set errorcolor brightwhite,red
# set selectedcolor brightwhite,cyan
# set numbercolor magenta
# set keycolor brightmagenta
# set functioncolor magenta

## Setup of syntax coloring.
##
## Format:
##
## syntax "short description" ["filename regex" ...]
##
## "color" will do case-sensitive matches, while "icolor" will do
## case-insensitive matches.
##
## Valid colors: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan.
## For foreground colors, you may use the prefix "bright" to get a
## stronger highlight.
##
## If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
## color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
## to set the background color to black or white.
