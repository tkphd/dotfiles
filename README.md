# dotfiles

Configuration files for [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[`emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/),
[`i3wm`](https://i3wm.org/)
with my personal preferences.

Run `setup.sh` to symlink the contents of this folder to the
appropriate user locations (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.emacs.d/init.el`, etc).
